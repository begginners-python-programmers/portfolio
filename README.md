# portfolio
I want to make a portfolio application with GUI for a friend of mine who is a graphic designer, I´m also a beginner in Python.

I love this programming world of "App Development" and I would like a lot to learn how to first code my program and then make a graphical
user interface for it, it´s my dream! 

Also, this project it´s for learning purposes of all of you that want to help me developing this application.

I like a lot modern GUI´s and I wish knowing how to code and create one.
